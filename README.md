# Symfony Coding Standard

WIP

Trying to fill the gaps of other symfony standards.

This has tests to ensure that the symfony coding standard is actually fulfilled.

At the moment there this is missing:
* properties_before_methods
* public_methods_first
* setup_teardown_methods_first
* expections_sprintf
* camel_case (for variables, parameters)
* sufix_exception
* filename_with_&_char (Use alphanumeric characters and underscores for file names)
* docblock_all_things
* docblock_return_flag
* docblock_package_subpackage_not_used
